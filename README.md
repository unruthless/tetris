# Tetris in OpenFrameworks

What: see above.

Why: because Tetris is fun and OpenFrameworks is useful.

## Requirements

- openFrameworks [v0.8.1](http://openframeworks.cc/download/)
- Xcode 5 (may work with earlier versions of Xcode, but untested, run at own risk.)

## Setup on OS X

1. Download and unarchive the openFrameworks repo into *~/of*
[http://www.openframeworks.cc/versions/v0.8.1/of_v0.8.1_osx_release.zip]

2. Clone the project into a *apps/tetris* folder root
```
$ git clone https://github.com/unruthless/of_tetris.git ~/of/apps/tetris
```

3. Build the application from Xcode.
